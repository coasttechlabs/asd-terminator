# asd-terminator
This game is about asd robots that go back in time to kill/destroy specific targets or items
there is two sides - the future asd robots(us) and the 21st centry robots or the normies (enermy)
but the normies robots kinda suck. A lot being cheap, small, dirty, made of plastic and smellier. But our robots, the asd's, are better stronger smarter and clean. 
The robots have many uses and are divided into multiplul roles such as medic wich can repair fellow robots, defender that can sheild allys from enemy fire and titan a tank being able to desamate the enemy but slow.
The weaponry is filled with 3 weapons that are the chain sword great close up ripping the other robots to shreds, but if close up ant your style the plasma gun will fit you being ok idk what to say its a gun you just shoot and they die. 
But if the normies ever want to do a peace tready we deploy the H BOMB this is a formidable bomb that will leave our enermies, the normies, in a state of confusion by loading so much info they cant keep up and give up giving us what we want.
As for the mechanics we have.
In order to complete the mission we must do the objective and get back to the future saftly where we will be able to see the changes in the future.
